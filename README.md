# BearFactoryCalculator
# This short program was created as part of my CS studies in 2020.
# The program calculates the production output of a competitor, by comparing the serial numbers of the number of bears collected in any given month.
# For e.g. if 5 bears are collected in January with serial numbers 54, 55 and 89, the production output for the competitor was 99 for January.
