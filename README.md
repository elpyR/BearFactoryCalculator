<h1>BearFactoryCalculator</h1>
<p>This short program was created as part of my CS studies in 2020.</p>
<p>The program calculates the production output of a competitor, by comparing the serial numbers of the number of bears collected in any given month.</p>
<p>For e.g. if 5 bears are collected in January with serial numbers 54, 55 and 89, the production output for the competitor was 99 for January.</p>
